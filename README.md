# myBone
myBone is a user friendly platform like Arduino for BBB (so that anyone could code easily without worrying much about the backend details).
Current Wiring Bone library (https://github.com/AbhraneelBera/wiringBone) supports almost all core actions and functions but is slow in terms of pin toggling. myBone is a  integration of basic Arduino features from Wiring Bone along with addition of features of Libpruio (http://beagleboard.org/project/libpruio/) for fast pin control. I also extended my work and built new C libraries for using pins in eQEP mode for reading values of quadrature encoder and customising DTO according to my need.
